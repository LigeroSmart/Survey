    <title>Usage</title>
    <section>
        <title>Create new Survey</title>
        <para>
            This feature lets OTRS users create new Survey by selecting the menu "SURVEY"
            and choosing "New".
        </para>
        <para>
            New Surveys require a title, an introduction text, a sender mail address, a mail
            subject, a mail body and an internal description of the Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            Additionally the new Survey can be created for just some queues.
            If none are selected, it will be valid for every Queue.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Add Questions</title>
        <para>
            As soon as a new Survey is created, the user can add questions to this Survey by
            clicking "Edit Questions" in the displayed Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            A new window will pop up. In there the user can add questions.
        </para>
        <para>
            Four types of questions are selectable. These are:
        </para>
        <para>
            "YesNo" questions a user can answer by selecting "Yes" or "No" of a drop down select.
        </para>
        <para>
            "Radio (List)" questions a user can answer by selecting exactly one and just one of the
            possible answers.
        </para>
        <para>
            "Checkbox (List)" questions a user can answer by selecting none to all listed answers.
        </para>
        <para>
            "Textarea" questions a user can write answers by typing regular text.
        </para>
        <para>
            For each answer type the OTRS user can choose
            if he wants a customer to be required to answer this question or if a customer can
            ignore the question.
        </para>
        <para>
            As soon as questions of type "Radio (List)" or "Checkbox (List)" got added, the question
            will be shown in the "Survey Questions"-List. By clicking on the question the user can
            add answers, change the answer order by clicking the "UP" or "DOWN" icon, or delete the
            answer by clicking the "DELETE" icon.
        </para>
        <para>
            Questions of type "Radio (List)" or "Checkbox (List)" needs to have at least two answers
            to be valid.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Start sending Survey requests</title>
        <para>
            When the OTRS user has finished adding or modifying questions and possible answers,
            he can leave the "Edit Questions" area by clicking "Close window".
        </para>
        <para>
            Back on the Survey detail page the user can select "Master" from the
            "- Change Status -" select.
        </para>
        <para>
            As soon as the Survey has the state "Master" the Survey is set live.
        </para>
        <para>
            Only one Survey can have the state "Master".
        </para>
        <para>
            If a Ticket got closed, the customer gets an E-Mail invitation to fill the Survey
            by clicking a link inside the invitation E-Mail.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Survey Results Graph</title>
        <para>
            By selecting "SURVEY" from the menu, choosing "Overview", clicking on a a Survey that
            customers already submitted and scrolling down, you can see the "Survey Results Graph".
        </para>
        <para>
            This displays the statistically a summary of questions (e.g. YesNo, Radio and Checkbox).
        </para>
        <para>
            As soon as the Survey has the state "Master" the Survey is set live.
        </para>
        <para>
            Questions where answers were configured as "required" will have one vote for each
            customer submitted Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            Questions where answers were not configured as "required" are optional for the customer.
            This means that for example 200 customers submitted the Survey but in the statistic in
            total only 10 or 20 answers may occur, if customers did not select any of the Radio
            (List), YesNo or checkbox answers or haven't put anything in a textarea answer.
        </para>
        <para>
            Statistics for required Checkbox (List) questions will have at least one checked value
            for every submitted Survey but due to it's nature of been multiple clickable there may
            be more answers than the total amount of submitted Surveys. Example: 200 Surveys
            submitted by customers, 350 answers on one Checkbox (List) question.
        </para>
        <para>
            Statistics for not required questions may have less votes than the total amount of
            submitted Surveys (answer is optional).
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Statistics Details</title>
        <para>
            By selecting "SURVEY" from the menu, choosing "Overview", clicking on a Survey that
            customers already submitted and choosing "Stats Details" you can see a list containing
            the time the Survey invitation was sent to the customer, the time the customer submitted
            his filled Survey, the Ticket (clickable) and a magnifying glass that shows the selected
            votes for this customer.
        </para>
        <para>
            In there you can find the answers the customer chose or typed in question by question.
        </para>
        <para>
            Especially Textarea answers are of interest in here.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Modifying Survey</title>
        <para>
            As soon as a Survey had the Status "Master" the possible modifications are limited. So
            please make sure to have especially the amount of questions as well as the amount of
            answers correctly configured before changing it's status to Master.
        </para>
        <warning>
            <para>
                In a Survey of type "Master" you can not add or delete questions any more.
            </para>
        </warning>
        <para>
            In a Survey of type Master you can change the general info (e.g. Title, Introduction,
            Sender,...), the question text, the answer text, as well as the order of the answers.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can change the "Answer Required" part of a question too, but this may just make
            sense as long as there are no submitted customer Surveys.
        </para>
        <para>
            Changing a "Answer Required" Question to answer not required makes the answer optional,
            so the statistic for this question may not have an answer for each submitted customer
            Survey any more.
        </para>
        <para>
            Changing a "Answer not Required" Question to answer required will require future Survey
            customers to give a vote for this question, but will not add votes for already submitted
            Surveys. So statistics will render rather useless too.
